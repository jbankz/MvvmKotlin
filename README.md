# MvvmKotlin
Implementation of MVVM Architecture in Kotlin

The app uses the **MVVM Architecture**. I have used the following components for development:

* Room - For offline data persistence
* LiveData - Handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion 
* ViewModel - Manage your UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
* Pojo - Plain Old Java Object
