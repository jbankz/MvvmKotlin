# Note-App
Note App is a simple application where in users can pen down. 
This app also makes use of the complete MVVM Architecture in kotlin Language.

The app uses the **MVVM Architecture**. I have used the following components for development:

* Room - For offline data persistence
* LiveData - Handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion 
* ViewModel - Manage your UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
* Pojo - Plain Old Java Object

The user clicks on a button which takes the user a screen where the user can add an activity and the user can also update an activity by clicking on the item that needs to be updated.
